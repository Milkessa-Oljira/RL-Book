TAIrritory is a strategic board game where two players compete to control the center of a 7x3 grid. Each player has unique pieces that can move forward in their territory and interact by swapping positions with opposite-type pieces. The goal is to strategically position more of your pieces in the center row, creating a dynamic and thoughtful gameplay experience that emphasizes spatial strategy over piece elimination.
